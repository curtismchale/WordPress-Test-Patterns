# WP Test Patterns

There really aren't a bunch of test patterns kicking around for WordPress so we're writing some.

This repo is intended to hold a bunch of WordPress test patterns and great doc blocks to explain why we're testing that way.

If you have a test pattern that would be helpful to others please add a pull request.
