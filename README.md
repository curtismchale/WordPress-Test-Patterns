# WP Test Patterns

There really aren't a bunch of test patterns kicking around for WordPress so we're writing some.

This repo is intended to hold a bunch of WordPress test patterns and great doc blocks to explain why we're testing that way.

If you have a test pattern that would be helpful to others please add a pull request.

### Getting this running

The easiest way to get Unit Tests running is to start using [VVV](https://github.com/varying-vagrant-vagrants/vvv/) since it has everything installed already for you.

Then SSH in to your Vagrant Box and change directory to the plugin. Type `phpunit` and all the test should pass.

Need some more information, check out [this presentation on Unit Testing](http://slides.com/curtismchale/getting-started-with-unit-testing/#/) which has a bunch of links to other setup resources at the end.
